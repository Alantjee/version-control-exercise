# version-control-exercise
this is a on overview file for all version control exercises of week 5 of dprep.

Really cool tutorial, some difficulties in the beginning with the git prompt, especially merging files but getting used to it now. Nice to see the website being updated so smoothly when you change a fle on your local computer with only 2 lines in the command line.
